Thanks for your interest in this project!

## Maintenance Note

This is a **personal tool** that I maintain for my own use. Updates happen when I need new features or bug fixes.

**Response time may vary** - I work on this in my spare time when it benefits my workflow.

## How to Contribute

### Bug Reports

If you find a bug:
1. Check if it's already reported in Issues
2. If not, open a new issue with:
   - Clear description of the problem
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Your environment (OS, Go version, Chrome version)
   - Example markdown file (if relevant)

### Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome! But keep in mind:
- I prioritize features I personally need
- If you want a feature urgently, consider implementing it yourself and submitting a PR

### Pull Requests

PRs are welcome!

**Before you start:**
- Open an issue first to discuss the change
- Keep changes focused and small
- Follow existing code style
- Test your changes

**PR Guidelines:**
- Clear description of what and why
- Reference related issues
- Include example usage if adding features

### Code Style

- Go formatting: Use `gofmt`
- Comments for non-obvious code
- Keep it simple - this is a small tool

## Questions?

Open an issue! I'll respond when I can.

## Fork It!

If you need something different or want faster updates, feel free to fork! That's what open source is for. ðŸš€
